![PhenixMates Technologies Inc.](./assets/PhoenixMates_logo_and_name.png)

## Introduction

This is a custom Visual Studio Code theme that combines the best elements from multiple themes to provide clarity and ease of use. It aims to improve readability and reduce confusion by using distinct colors for different elements like objects, variables, constants, functions, classes, attributes, and more.

## Motivation

I found myself frequently switching between themes because while some provided clarity, they often used the same color for different elements, causing confusion. So, I decided to create a custom theme that incorporates my favorite color patterns from the themes I've used in the past.

The result is a theme that is easy on the eyes and makes reading and writing code a breeze. Most importantly, it clearly highlights different syntax elements, making it easy to distinguish between variables, constants, functions, objects, classes, attributes, and more.
